# [338. Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-09-01)

Given an integer `n`, return an array `ans` of length `n + 1` such that for each `i` (`0 <= i <= n`), `ans[i]` is the **number of ** `1`**'s**  in the binary representation of `i`.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101
```

**Constraints:** 

- `0 <= n <= 10^5`

**Follow up:** 

- It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of `O(n log n)`. Can you do it in linear time `O(n)` and possibly in a single pass?
- Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like `__builtin_popcount` in C++)?

**Hint**
> (1/3) You should make use of what you have produced already.

> (2/3) Divide the numbers in ranges like [2-3], [4-7], [8-15] and so on. And try to generate new range from previous.

>(3/3) Or does the odd/even status of the number help you in calculating the number of 1s?

**Solution:**
```
